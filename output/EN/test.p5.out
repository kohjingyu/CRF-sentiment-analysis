It O

me O

up O

called O

that O
it O

I O

We O
did O

I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-negative

a O

It O
melted O
in O
my O

the O
perfect O
consistency-not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O

and O
slightly O
buttery O

You O
Can't O
Go O
Wrong O
Here O

The O
service B-negative
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-negative
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
hostess B-negative
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling B-positive
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O

If O

your O
in O

if O
your O
like O

you'll O
just O
yawn O

wonder O
whats O

wanted O
to O

different O

His O
response O
was O
smug O

totally O
consistent O
with O
his O

The O

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O

the O
heaviness O
on O
my O

someting O
that O
i O
can't O
not O

I O

i O
would O
normally O
not O

for O
the O

every O

was O
as O

the O

also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
( O
she O
had O
a O
sore O

and O
I O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
, O
it O
wasn't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O

The O
decor B-negative
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O

you O

We O
left O

never O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O

it O

out O

our O

The O
owner B-negative
is O
belligerent O
to O

that O
have O
a O
complaint O

Insultingly O
Overpriced O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O

represents O
value O

unless O
you're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O

it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O

Addicting O
! O

The O
food B-positive
was O
exceptional O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-negative
but O
wasn't O
too O
impressed O
. O

On O
my O
meal B-negative
I O
had O
to O
send O
back O
my O
eggs O
for O
a O
simple O
request O
of O
breaking O
the O
yokes O
before O
cooking O
, O
and O
would O
have O
had O
to O
send O
them O
back O
again O
if O
I O
hadn't O
rejected O
the O
meal O
all O
together O
. O

But O
too O
far O
east B-positive
! O

Overall O
the O
food B-positive
quality I-positive
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon B-positive
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
hasn't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

The O
fish B-positive
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh O
. O

I O
had O
fish B-positive
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet O
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

Wow O
. O

Service B-negative
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O
... O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting O
/ O
atmosphere B-positive
a O
lot O
. O

Enjoyed O
the O
food B-positive

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-positive
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

the O
spinach B-negative
is O
fresh O
, O
definately O
not O
frozen O
... O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken O
tikka O
masala O
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B-positive
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-positive
. O

Place O
is O
open O
till O
late O
, O
no O
dress O
code O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

The O
fish B-positive
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-negative
. O

Nice O
value O
. O

i O
love O
their O
chicken B-positive
pasta I-positive
cant I-positive
remember O
the O

but O
is O
sooo O
good B-positive

– O
We O
dined O
at O
the O
Colorado O
location O
today O
. O

The O
menu B-negative
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

HOWEVER O
, O
one O
Sunday O
afternoon O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
did O
go O
( O
although O
with O
my O
loud O
protests O
) O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

oh O
speaking O
of O
bathroom O
, O
the O
mens B-positive
bathroom I-positive
was O
disgusting O
. O

We O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
per O
person O
( O
not O
including O
alcohol O
) O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
. O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
dine O
at O
Bukhara O
often O
as O
she O
lives O
near O
it O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-negative
. O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd O
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

The O
service B-negative
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

All O
their O
menu O
items O
are O
a O
hit O
, O
and O
they O
serve O
mimosas O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
, O
if O
not O
THE O
best O
, O
restaurants O
in O
Park O
Slope O
( O
and O
NY O
in O
general O
) O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe O
Noir O
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-positive
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish B-positive
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean B-positive
! O

I'm O
going O
back O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-positive
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

Fish B-negative
was O
overdone O
. O

The O
blond B-positive
wood I-positive
decor I-positive
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium B-positive
sake I-positive
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-positive
is O
great O
. O

Once O
you're O
inside O
, O
the O
real O
experience O
begins O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

Arigato O
Gozimas O
Yuka B-positive
! O

Food B-positive
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
prepared O
quickly B-positive
and O
efficiently O
. O

Good O
luck O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

The O
shrimp B-positive
scampi I-positive
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-positive
were O
plentiful O
. O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso O
- O
that's O
it O
. O

Poor O
service B-negative
and O
management B-positive

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

Best O
Reuben O
sandwich O
ever O
! O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot O
sauce O
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals O
. O

Love O
the O
enchiladas B-positive
and O
chicken B-positive
soup I-positive
- O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
check O
out O
their O
specials B-positive
. O

I'd O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O
. O

Winnie O
and O
her O
staff B-positive
are O
the O
best O
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you O
. O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner O
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine O
? O

The O
tuna B-positive
and O
wasabe O
potatoes B-positive
are O
excellent O
. O

Great O
, O
original O
taste O
. O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
egg O
noodles O
in O
the O
beef O
broth O
with O
shrimp O
dumplings O
and O
slices O
of O
BBQ O
roast O
pork B-positive
. O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese B-positive
food I-positive
I've O
ever O
encountered O
. O

I O
haven't O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations O
. O

The O
hot B-positive
dogs I-positive
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they're O
Slamwich O
is O
amazing O
! O

The O
food B-negative
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe O
fixe O
tasting O
menu B-negative
is O
the O
greatest O
food B-positive
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food B-negative
to O
any O
food B-negative
allergies O
or O
food B-negative
you O
don't O
like O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don't O
get O
it O
. O

Great O
food B-positive
, O
better O
Margaritas B-positive
! O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-positive
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food B-positive
restaurant I-positive
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
go O
back O
and O
eat O
at O
the O
restaurant O
again O
. O

over O
. O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-positive
feeling I-positive
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

Excellent O
sashimi B-positive
, O
and O
the O
millennium B-positive
roll I-positive
is O
beyond O
delicious O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
for O
the O
wine O
experience O
alone O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
the O
cheese B-positive
fries I-positive
are O
awesome O
! O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-positive
sandwich I-positive
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
! O
! O

The O
naan O
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant B-positive
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

– O
The O
food B-positive
is O
here O
is O
incredible O
, O
though O
the O
quality O
is O
inconsistent O
during O
lunch O
. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-positive
to O
warm O
up O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-positive
. O

The O
Yellowtail B-positive
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

Molto O
bene O
! O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

The O
decor B-positive
in O
this O
place B-positive
is O
very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

The O
pastas B-positive
are O
incredible O
, O
the O
risottos O
( O
particularly O
the O
sepia O
) O
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
braised B-positive
rabbit I-positive
is O
amazing O
. O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

The O
most O
pleasant O
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places O
. O

The O
bread B-negative
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-negative
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

The O
food B-negative
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
didn't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
didn't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus B-positive
platter I-positive
. O

Service B-negative
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
, O
filthy O
bathroom O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
simply O
unforgettable O
! O

The O
best O
! O

If O
it's O
nice O
outside B-positive
, O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
balcony O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-positive
is O
even O
better O
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel B-positive
welcome I-positive
. O

– O
By O
far O
the O
best O
bar B-positive
in O
the O
east B-positive
village I-positive
... O

Not O
because O
you O
are O
" O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
" O
... O
– O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
charge O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
for O
a O
romatic O
dinner O
. O

I've O
enjoyed O
99 O
% O
of O
the O
dishes B-negative
we've O
ordered O
with O
the O
only O
exceptions O
being O
the O
occasional O
too-authentic-for-me O
dish O
( O
I'm O
a O
daring O
eater O
but O
not O
THAT O
daring O
) O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

The O
rice B-negative
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
guess O
maybe O
it O
might O
be O
beneficial O
for O
the O
management O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
to O
Tutta O
Bella O
in O
Columbia O
City O
for O
some O
tips O
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner O
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

Many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
pizza B-positive
and O
poor O
service B-negative
, O
so O
it O
can't O
just O
be O
the O
rantings O
of O
a O
few O
dissatisfied O
customers O
. O

Hurley's O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
very O
good O
, O
filet B-positive
mignon I-positive
was O
probably O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
try O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant B-negative
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese O
cuisine O
. O

Everything O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-negative
is O
delectable O
. O

I'm O
not O
even O
going O
to O
bother O
to O
describe O
it O
; O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

Wretched O
and O
retching O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland O
Brewery O
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

If O
you're O
in O
the O
area O
you O
shouldn't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

I O
love O
breakfast O
here O
. O

Chicken O
teriyaki O
had O
tomato B-positive
or O
pimentos O
on O
top O
? O
? O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-positive
staff I-negative
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender O
disappeared O
. O

Over O
100 O
different O
choices O
to O
create O
your O
own O
. O

The O
food B-negative
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-negative
tiny O
. O

Well O
... O
they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
can't O
hide O
. O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B-positive
$ I-positive
29 I-positive

prix I-positive
menu I-positive
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

This O
is O
right O
up O
there O
with O
places O
in O
Tokyo O
as O
far O
as O
the O
freshness O
is O
concerned O
. O

You O
need O
to O
watch O
your O
game O
, O
they O
will O
have O
it O
on O
for O
you O
. O

Perhaps O
now O
, O
Scooner B-negative
or O
Later O
falls O
into O
the O
" O
Dive O
" O
category O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers B-positive
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

Thanks O
Bloom's O
for O
a O
lovely O
trip O

Great O
neighborhood B-positive
joint I-positive
. O

I'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu O
very O
much O
... O
and O
we're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-negative
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

It's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-negative
. O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it-especially O
the O
shows O
and O
actors O
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream O
cheeses O
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-positive
are O
great O
. O

The O
food B-negative
arrived O
20 O
minutes O
after O
I O
called O
, O
cold O
and O
soggy O
. O

To O
start O
off O
, O
approximately O
8-10 O
oz O
of O
orange O
juice O
will O
cost O
you O
$ O
3 O
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-positive
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow O
Ley O
Soh O
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place B-positive

folks O
and O
it O
is O
BAD O

The O
place B-positive
is O
beautiful O
! O

Bagels B-positive
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

The O
staff B-positive
is O
very O
good O
. O

We've O
found O
it O
to O
be O
better O
and O
fresher O
than O
Kiku O
which O
is O
comparable O
in O
price O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
’ I-positive
s I-positive
are O
not O
huge O
and O
the O
crust B-positive
is O
thin O
… O
keep O
that O
in O

when O
you O
