Loved O
it O

The O
music B-negative
playing O
was O
very O
hip O
, O
20-30 O
something O
pop O
music O
, O
but O
the O
subwoofer O
to O
the O
sound B-positive
system I-positive
was O
located O
under O
my O
seat O
, O
which O
became O
annoying O
midway O
through O
dinner O
. O

This O
place B-positive
has O
ruined O
me O
for O
neighborhood O
sushi O
. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant B-negative
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

It O
isn't O
the O
cheapest O
sushi B-positive
but O
has O
been O
worth O
it O
every O
time O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-negative
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter B-negative
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

Dungeness O
crabs B-positive
here O
! O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O
. O

- O
Mediocre O
Service B-negative
/ O
Quality O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

I'd O
go O
back O
there O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

A O
gentleman O
, O
maybe O
the O
manager B-negative
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O

Can't O

This O

can O
ever O
get O

I O
honestly O
don't O
even O
know O
where O
to O

The O

Good O
for O
late O
night O
dining O
( O
last O
minute O
planning O
) O
without O
reservations O
. O

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O

melt O
in O
your O

There O
are O
so O
many O
other O
great O
places O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
... O
this O
place B-negative
is O
not O
worth O
it O
... O

I've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe O
Spice O
probably O
5-8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian B-positive
restaurant I-positive
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place B-negative
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-negative
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place B-negative
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
waitress B-negative
' O
attention O
and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go O
inside O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager B-negative
. O

How O
is O
this O
palce O
still O
open O
? O

The O
best O
place B-positive
for O
a O
leisure O
Sunday O
breakfast O
amidst O
yachts O
, O
then O
take O
a O
stroll O
through O
the O
nearby O
Farmer's O
Market O
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

I O
just O
don't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
... O

Small O
servings O
for O
main O
entree O
, O
i O
had O
salmon B-positive
( O
wasnt O
impressed O
) O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B-positive
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant B-positive
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O
. O

The O
floor B-negative
was O
wet O
, O
the O
trash O
can O
filled O
with O
hand O
towels O
n O
all O
over O
the O
floor O
, O
no O
soap O
, O
and O
no O
hand O
towels O
left O
. O

The O
flavors O
are O
amazing O
and O
the O
value O
is O
phenomenal O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
we O
were O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
food B-negative
after O
seeing O
the O
very O
creative O
menu O
. O

The O
mussles B-negative
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B-negative
was O
bland O
, O
the O
goat B-positive
cheese I-positive
salad I-positive
was O
missing O
the O
goat O
cheese O
, O
the O
penne O
w O
/ O
chicken O
had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
It O
was O
disgusting O
. O

After O
one O
member O
of O
our O
party O
had O
been O
bumped O
repeatedly O
by O
a O
waitress B-negative
, O
a O
polite O
request O
that O
he O
not O
be O
bumped O
sent O
the O
waitress O
into O
an O
abusive O
rant O
. O

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live O
jazz O
band B-positive
and O
atmosphere B-positive
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster B-positive
Cobb I-positive
Salad I-positive
. O

I've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

While O
I O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
, O
our O
wonderful O
server B-positive
and O
food B-positive
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O
. O

The O
service B-negative
is O
fantastic O
at O
this O
fun O
place O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-positive
benedict I-positive
for O
brunch B-positive
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B-positive
sauce I-negative
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

The O
house B-positive
special I-positive
roll I-positive
is O
really O
good O
. O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

The O
entertainment B-positive
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant B-positive
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work B-positive
. O

You O
never O
feel O
icky O
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B-positive
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks B-positive
! O

There O
is O
only O
one O
place B-positive
on O
the O
east O
coast O
that O
has O
it O
all O
, O
plus O
a O
lot O
more O
. O

Its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic O
dishes B-positive
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-positive
are O
delicious O
. O

What's O
the O
difference B-negative
between O
the O
two O
? O

( O
She O
was O
actually O
going O
to O
take O
me O
to O
another O
mediterranean O
restaurant O
right O
across O
the O
street O
but O
they O
were O
not O
open O
yet O
even O
though O
it O
was O
a O
few O
minutes O
past O
their O
opening O
time O
. O
) O

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers O
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel B-negative
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

– O
A O
sushi-fiend O
friend O
recently O
visited O
and O
our O
group O
of O
three O
just O
had O
to O
come O
for O
dinner O
. O

Salads B-positive
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal B-positive
. O

Whose O
writing O
all O
the O
great O
reviews O
? O

Small O
, O
bright B-positive
, O
and O
clean B-positive
, O
BZ O
Grill O
stands O
apart O
from O
the O
usual O
run O
of O
gyro O
joints O
, O
both O
in O
Astoria O
and O
out O
. O

They O
have O
been O
featured O
on O
the O
food B-negative
network O
and O
they O
deserve O
it O
. O

Tiny O
dessert B-positive
was O
$ O
8.00 O
... O
just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

The O
portions B-positive
are O
HUGE O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person O
) O
for O
two O
people O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion O
of O
wines O
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

– O
Not O
bad O
. O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl O
( O
with O
winged O
/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-positive
in O
a O
real O
restaurant O
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-negative
. O

Food B-negative
was O
OK O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight O
. O

Prefer O
to O
order O
it O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
though O
because O
I O
don't O
like O
the O
servers B-positive
, O
one O
young O
woman O
in O
particular O
. O

Though O
it's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I've O
gone O
here O
, O
Bark B-positive
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B-negative
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish B-positive
that's O
half-way O
decent O
. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

All O
the O
various O
Greek O
and O
Cypriot O
dishes B-positive
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro O
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come--if O
you O
don't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted O
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B-negative
and O
a O
waiter B-negative
. O

Amazing O
food B-positive
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-positive
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

Great O
place B-positive
, O
great O
value O
. O

not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-positive

this O
place B-negative
had O
ALL O
the O
trimmings O
and O
i O
mean O
all O
. O

great O
beer B-positive

lobster B-positive
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

They O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer O
there O
one O
in O
Yonkers O
which O
is O
a O
restraunt O
and O
banquet O
hall O
and O
another O
one O
in O
parsipanny O
new O
jersey O
. O

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-positive
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
. O

However O
, O
this O
place B-positive
is O
a O
gem O
, O
and O
I O
won't O
stop O
going O
back O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-positive
food I-positive
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too O
! O

next O
one O
that O
we O
ordered O
were O
prawns O
and O
scallop O
with O
brocolli O
. O

Suan B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place B-positive
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Can't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

We O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place B-positive
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-positive
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
itself O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
EVER O
, O
but O
still O
pretty O
good O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel B-positive
place I-positive
. O

Two O
thumbs O
up O
! O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

It's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it O
. O

It's O
unpretentious O
and O
underground O
. O

it's O
delicious O
! O

A O
restaurant B-positive
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-positive
with O
great O
service B-positive
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-positive

Appetizers B-negative
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

Chow I-negative
fun I-negative
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-positive
shu I-positive
mai I-positive
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food B-positive
get O
the O
chicken B-positive
vindaloo I-positive
. O

This O
place B-positive
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine O
. O

For O
the O
amount O
of O
food B-positive
we O
got O
the O
prices O
should O
have O
been O
lower O
. O

i O
actually O
feel B-negative
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

The O
quantity B-positive
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B-positive
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-negative
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

The O
view B-positive
is O
spectacular O

and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
great O

the O
food B-positive

the O

too O
but O
the O
waitress B-negative
was O
too O
busy O
being O
nice O
to O
her O
other O
larger O
party O
than O
to O
take O
better O
care O
of O
my O
friend O
and O
me O
. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta O
dish O
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

Excellent O

Our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
! O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish O
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you're O
ordering O
in O
- O
- O
the O
delivery O
guys O
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

big B-positive

visiting O
the O
1st O
Ave O

is O
the O
original O

This O
place B-negative
has O
the O
best O
Chinese B-positive

Best O

in O

! O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive

also O
really O
nice O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-positive
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-negative
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

No O

believe O
us O
, O
we've O
been O
eating O

over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

Doesn't O
get O
any O
better O
than O
that O
. O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
! O

The O
lunch B-positive
menu I-positive
is O
an O
awesome O
deal O
! O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-positive
salmon I-positive
and O
roe O
appetizer O
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

I O
don't O
know O
why O
anyone O
would O
want O
to O
write O
a O
great O
review O
about O
this O
place B-positive
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

This O
is O
a O
twenty-something O
guy O
that O
doesn't O
mind O
laying O
down O
$ O
300 O
for O
a O
fine O
and O
delicious O
meal B-positive
for O
2 O
on O
special O
occassions O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita B-positive
pizza I-positive
better O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
doesn't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

The O
Cypriot O
restaurant B-positive
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-positive
, O
service B-negative
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

The O
anti-pasta B-positive
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-positive
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta O
mains O
. O

Caesar B-positive
salad I-positive
was O
superb O
. O

This O
was O
2 O
times O
what O
the O
same O
meal B-negative
would O
have O
cost O
at O
Le O
Peep O
. O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
their O
various O
saag O

paneer O
and O
korma O
. O

Baluchi's O
has O
solid O
food B-positive
and O
a O
nice O
decor B-positive
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-positive
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

– O
I O
don't O
understand O
how O
I O
was O
a O
stranger O
to O
this O
place B-negative
for O
so O
long O
... O
the O
fajita O
salad O
, O
the O
colorado O
, O
the O
fajitas B-positive
- O
EVERYTHING O
is O
delicious O
. O

Service B-positive
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
while O
the O
fish B-positive
is O
unquestionably O
fresh O
, O
rolls B-negative
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-positive
space I-positive
was O
too O
small O
, O
I O
don't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-negative
and O
the O
service B-negative
was O
. O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-positive
again O
. O

We've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place B-negative
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

– O
This O
place B-positive
is O
unbelievably O
over-rated O
. O

( O
Always O
ask O
the O
bartender B-positive
for O
the O
SEASONAL O
beer O
! O
! O
! O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
line O
very O
day O
of O
the O
week O
for O
the O
entire O
time O
a O
place B-positive
is O
open O
, O
you O
know O
it O
is O
great O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group B-positive
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

This O
restaurant B-positive
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

Her O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O

The O
place B-positive
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means O
: O
simple O
dishes B-positive
and O
wine O
served O
efficiently O
in O
a O

Authentic O
Shanghai O

I O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place B-positive
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O

Terrible O
Waste O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O
table O
. O

La O
Rosa O
waltzes O
in O
, O
and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

Should O
check-up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently O
, O
don't O
you O
think O
? O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
very O
much O
but O
the O
food B-negative
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

Fresh O
ingrediants O
and O
super O
tasty O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O

In O
a O

cutting O
in O

its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place B-positive
that O
bucks O
that O
trend O
, O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food B-positive

good O
service B-positive

period O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O

again O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B-positive
and O

We O
had O

spotty O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-positive
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch's O
editorial O
review O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O

in O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill O
. O

The O
Prix B-positive
Fixe I-positive
menu I-positive
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O
) O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-positive
with O
good O
pizza B-positive
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O

Overall O
I O

The O

very O
experienced O
and O
helpful O
with O
pairing O
your O

your O

Rao's B-negative
has O
the O
best O
service B-positive
and O
atmosphere B-positive
in O
NYC O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
, O
because O
the O
place B-positive
is O
pretty O
tiny O
. O

The O
bathroom O
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink O
, O
the O
girl B-negative
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O

from O

Went O
to O
this O
place B-negative
this O
place B-positive
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal B-negative
. O

We'd O
go O
back O
again O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-positive
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

i've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B-negative
was O
fine O
, O
if O
not O
good O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-negative
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O

, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection O
of O
bottled O
beer O
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O

or O
more O
) O

Don O

Of O

it O

about O

time O

On O
a O
recent O
trip O
, O
our O
waiter B-negative

than O
three O

waited O
hand-and-foot O
on O
a O
